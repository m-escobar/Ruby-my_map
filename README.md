# Ruby-my_map

Do you know how to use &block in a ruby method?

It's simple, just create a method and call this one with a block.

Inside the method you can do whatever you want with the block.

In this case I've added the 'Class' for Array and String, in this way you can pass an array or string as parameter and use them inside the method.

Check the sample code on my_map.rb
